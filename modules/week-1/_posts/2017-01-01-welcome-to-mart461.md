<p>This week we are going to start with an introduction to <b>What is Web Server Programming</b>  It's important so we can distinguish between what is a client and what is a server and how they work together.</p>

This class is a programming class however it is assumed that you have a good understanding of programming concepts.  This class includes instruction on C# using the .NET Framework 4.7, PHP, MS SQL and MySQL.  Although these platforms are used, it will not prevent you from leveraging other tools provided by other vendors.  The concepts covered in this class are generic in nature and should translate to any language/platform of your choice.</p>

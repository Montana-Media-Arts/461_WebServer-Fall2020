This week we are going to start with an introduction to **What is Web Server Programming**  It's important so we can distinguish between what is a client and what is a server and how they work together.

As per the syllabus, this class is designed to give you a good general understanding of how to program server-side code.  Having knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other client side programming is a plus, but not a requirement. We will focus primarily on the server side and not the client side. This class is a programming class however it is assumed that you have a good understanding of programming concepts.  This class includes instruction on C# using the .NET Framework 4.7, PHP, MS SQL and MySQL.  Although these platforms are used, it will not prevent you from leveraging other tools provided by other vendors.  The concepts covered in this class are generic in nature and should translate to any language/platform of your choice.

Upon completing this course, you will be able to: 

Explain the fundamental concepts that are essential to web server development, including but not limited to:

• Leverage web server techniques to implement a project
• Integrate a full stack web server application
• Work with a diverse project team
• Implement a database
• Generate and apply test plans for web server applications
• Deploy a web application to a server
